I was responsible for testing, conducting and evaulating this lab for 2nd year Mechatronics students.

The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to techniques for debugging programs on embedded systems. 
After completing this lab, you should be able to:
● Identify and fix C syntax errors
● Understand and fix common compile time errors
● Identify code that does not conform to common C formatting standards and make the appropriate changes
● Use the debugger to
    ○ Watch local and global variables
    ○ Check the contents of memory
    ○ Set breakpoints
    ○ Step through code
● Correct logic errors
